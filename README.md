For this project, I built an application to meet the following functionality:

* Displays a map of the world, which a user can move and zoom 
* When a user clicks on a given location, the webapp should display the current weather data for that location 

I used the following services' APIs: 

* [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/overview/) is a great tool to use  for rendering maps
* Open source weather data can be found at [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/current)
