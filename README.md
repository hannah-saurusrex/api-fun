# Eng-Test

We would like you to build an application that can meet the following functionality:

* Displays a map of the world, which a user can move and zoom 
* When a user clicks on a given location, the webapp should display the current weather data for that location 

Notes:

* Do this test in what ever language and way you feel comfortable in. Ideally the UI portion is a webapp of some form
* Use this test as a showcase of good development practices
* Please include instructions on how to run your application as a part of submitting

Helpful Hints:

* [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/overview/) is a great tool to use  for rendering maps
* Open source weather data can be found at [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/current)
